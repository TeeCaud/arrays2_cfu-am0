# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?

Mostly confident.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

I had some productive strugle remembering methods.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I just need some repetition to better memorize some of the steps.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

When is the best time to use an iteration? I will learn through mod0/cohort or ask instructors or students.
